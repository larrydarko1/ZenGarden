/**
 * Testing standards gate — the mechanically checkable half of the shared testing
 * standard. The rules live in @larrydarko/lint-config/gates/testing; what stays here
 * is this repo's answers.
 *
 * `layout: mirrored` — tests mirror `src/` under `tests/`, one top-level directory
 * per `src/` directory. The standard picked this over co-located `__tests__/` and
 * the whole value is consistency: a suite in the other pattern is not wrong so much
 * as unfindable. A `tests/` directory mirroring nothing is a tree you have to search
 * rather than navigate, so a new area is added here and in `src/` together.
 *
 * `e2e: false` — a decision, not a gap. Playwright's Electron API is experimental,
 * so the app is covered by unit and component suites instead, and adding E2E is
 * raised first rather than done: a config, a directory or a dependency appearing
 * unannounced fails rather than lands quietly. That same switch is what makes a `.spec` file
 * fail here: Vitest matches `.test.ts` and nothing else, so a `.spec` is run by
 * nothing at all while still reading as a test.
 *
 * `thresholds` and `excludes` are the two numbers-only rules from the standard:
 * thresholds ratchet up and never down ("lowering a threshold to make a red build
 * green is fixing the number that defines failure"), and the exclude list may not
 * grow. Each exclude carries the reason it is not a coverage gap, written once here
 * instead of sitting unexplained in a config file.
 *
 * `vmBaseline: 0` — "test behaviour, not implementation". `wrapper.vm.someRef` is
 * the mechanical form, but a legitimate escape hatch often enough that a ban would
 * be wrong, so it is counted rather than forbidden. `$`-prefixed members ($nextTick,
 * $emit) are Vue's public instance API and never counted.
