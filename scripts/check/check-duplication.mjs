/**
 * Duplication (DRY) gate.
 * Enforced two ways, because a percentage alone is a bad alarm:
 *   1. A PER-FORMAT CEILING. Ratcheted just above where the codebase sits today,
 *      so the number can only be driven down. Split by format because the three
 *      have genuinely different stakes, and one blended number hides all of them:
 *        • typescript is LOGIC. Two copies of a branch is the case that actually
 *          costs you a bug.
 *        • scss is presentation. Repetition there is real debt (it is what the
 *          token system and the shared mixins in components.scss exist to
 *          absorb), but a stale copy makes something look wrong, not behave
 *          wrong — so it gets a looser ceiling, honestly labelled.
 *        • html is SFC template markup, where structural repetition is often the
 *          correct answer and extracting a component would cost more than it saves.
 *   2. A CAP ON ANY SINGLE CLONE. A percentage is a ratio, so it quietly improves
 *      as the codebase grows: a large new copy-paste can land while the number
 *      goes DOWN. This is the rule that catches the thing you actually care about
 *      — one big block pasted into a second place — independently of size.
 * A note on what this cannot judge: jscpd matches tokens, not intent. Two blocks
 * that look identical and mean different things are a false positive, and the
 * honest response is to raise the relevant ceiling with a comment rather than
 * contort the code. Every number below is a judgement, not a measurement.
