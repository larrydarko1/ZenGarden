/**
 * Dependency audit gate with a reviewed allowlist.
 * `npm audit` has no ignore mechanism, so a single upstream-blocked advisory
 * turns CI permanently red — and the usual reaction (dropping --audit-level to
 * critical) silently swallows every future high finding too. This wraps the
 * audit instead: high/critical advisories fail the build unless their GHSA is
 * explicitly listed below, with a reason.
 * The allowlist is deliberately awkward to maintain. Each entry must say why the
 * advisory cannot be fixed from here and why it is unreachable in ZenGarden's code.
 * An entry that no longer matches anything npm reports also fails the build:
 * upstream shipped the fix, so the waiver and any workaround it describes are
 * now stale. That is what stops a "temporary" exception becoming permanent.
