/**
 * tsconfig drift gate.
 * The compiler settles what is checked, and every rule here exists because a
 * config can be wrong in a way that makes MORE code compile, not less — so the
 * build stays green and the mistake is invisible until something ships:
 *   • a project that does not extend the base, or extends it FIRST in an
 *     `extends` array. Later entries win, so a base listed ahead of a preset is
 *     silently overridden — the file names the strict config and gets the
 *     lax one, which is exactly what `@vue/tsconfig` would do to the renderer;
 *   • a base flag re-declared weaker in one project with no reason written
 *     down. `noUnusedLocals: false` in a test config reads as housekeeping and
 *     is how a whole program stops reporting a category of dead code;
 *   • the base growing a `target`, a `lib` or an `outDir`. The renderer targets
 *     a Chromium the app ships with and the main process targets the bundled
 *     Node; those are different numbers and each file records its own;
 *   • `types` dropped from a project. The default is not "no globals", it is
 *     EVERY hoisted `@types/*` package — so the config still compiles and the
 *     program silently widens to whatever a transitive dependency installed;
 *   • `node` in the renderer's `types`. The renderer runs with context
 *     isolation and no Node integration: `process`, `Buffer` and `require` do
 *     not exist there at runtime. Typing them in means the compiler agrees with
 *     code that crashes in the packaged app, and the mistake only surfaces
 *     outside `npm run dev`;
 *   • a `target` and a `lib` naming different ES years, which types the old
 *     library surface while emitting the new syntax;
 *   • a project config no script ever runs. `tsconfig.test.json` was exactly
 *     that — a hardened config nothing ever pointed a compiler at;
 *   • a solution file — `files: []` plus `references`, which is what the root
 *     `tsconfig.json` is — pointed at with `-p` instead of `-b`. It has no
 *     input files of its own, so tsc loads it, compiles nothing and exits 0.
 *     Only build mode follows the references to the projects that hold the
 *     actual source.
