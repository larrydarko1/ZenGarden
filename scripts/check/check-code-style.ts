/**
 * Code style gate. The conventions ESLint has no opinion about: what a file is
 * called, how long it is, which order its parts come in, and which comment form
 * belongs in which block. None of it changes behaviour and all of it is invisible in
 * a diff — you read the import line, not the convention it broke — which is why it
 * needs a gate rather than a review. The rules live in
 * @larrydarko/lint-config/gates/code-style.
 *
 * What stays here is this repo's answers.
 *
 * `casing` — an SFC filename is PascalCase because it IS the component name: the tag
 * you write in a template, and the label devtools shows. Everything else under src/
 * is camelCase.
 *
 * `headers` — first match wins, so the order is the specificity. A main-process
 * module under lib/ or services/ owes a JSDoc block, because it owns an external
 * concern — the filesystem, a config file — and which one is not derivable from its
 * exports. A composable owes at least a `//` line saying what state it owns. An SFC
 * owes NOTHING: defineProps and defineEmits are the contract, and a prose header
 * above them is the one part nothing checks, so it is the part that goes stale.
 *
 * `baseline` is in the shared gate's unit: non-blank lines, and an SFC's `<style>`
 * block does not count. This repo used to count what `wc -l` counts, which was
 * drift — the code style standard says "files over ~400 lines (template and script
 * only, style can be ignored)". Re-measured in that unit, four of the five entries
 * were never over the cap; only their stylesheets were.

/**
 * Files over the 400-line softcap when the ratchet was set, at the size they were.
 * A file may shrink freely; growing past its entry, or a new file crossing the cap,
 * fails. Lower a number when you refactor, never raise it — and when one drops back
 * under the cap the gate says so, because an entry left behind is a licence to
 * regrow to the old number.
