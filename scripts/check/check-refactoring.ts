/**
 * Refactoring & change-management gate. Deferred work does not live in the code: a
 * `TODO` is a promise nobody is tracking, and it outlives its own deferral because
 * nothing ever re-reads it.
 *
 * ESLint's `no-warning-comments` covers every script it can parse. This gate covers
 * the rest — the file types with no parser, and the `<template>` half of an SFC, which
 * the rule never sees because vue-eslint-parser keeps it on a separate AST. Both live
 * in @larrydarko/lint-config/gates/refactoring, and every option it takes is already
 * right for this repo: `.vue` is linted, and `todo.md` is the tracker, gitignored here.
 *
 * The markers are matched uppercase-only, which is load-bearing here rather than
 * stylistic: the gate reads src/renderer/locales/*.json, where `todo` is an ordinary
 * Spanish and Portuguese word ("Copiar Todo", "todo lo que").
