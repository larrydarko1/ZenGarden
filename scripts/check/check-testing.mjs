/**
 * Testing standards gate — the mechanically checkable half of CONTRIBUTING.md
 * "Testing". Each section below is one rule from that document; if the two ever
 * disagree, the document is the standard and this file is the bug.
 *   1. PLACEMENT. Tests mirror `src/` under `tests/`. The standard picked this
 *      pattern over co-located `__tests__/` and the whole value is consistency —
 *      a suite in the other pattern is not wrong so much as unfindable.
 *   2. THE `.test.ts` SUFFIX. The folder is convention; the suffix is the
 *      mechanism. `include: ['tests/**\/*.test.ts']` means a `.spec.ts` is
 *      picked up by no runner at all — it stops running while still looking
 *      like a test.
 *   3. NO E2E SUITE. Also a decision, not a gap: Playwright's Electron API is
 *      experimental and an attempt here was removed. The standard says don't
 *      add one back without raising it first, so a config or dependency
 *      appearing unannounced fails rather than lands quietly.
 *   4. THE COVERAGE CONFIG, RATCHETED. Two numbers-only rules quoted from the
 *      standard: thresholds ratchet up and never down ("lowering a threshold to
 *      make a red build green is fixing the number that defines failure"), and
 *      the exclude list may not grow. Without this, the cheapest way to clear a
 *      coverage failure is to edit the definition of failure.
 *   5. NOTHING AT 0%. The aggregate hides individual files: at 87% statements a
 *      whole untested module is a rounding error.
 *   6. SUITE HYGIENE. The ways a suite goes wrong while every run stays green,
 *      so none of them announce themselves: `.only`, `.skip`, bare `test()`,
 *      commented-out tests, duplicate titles inside one `describe`.
 *   7. COMPONENT INTERNALS, AS A RATCHET. "Test behaviour, not implementation."
 *      `wrapper.vm.someRef` is the mechanical form — but it is a legitimate
 *      escape hatch often enough that a ban would be wrong, so it is counted,
 *      not forbidden. `$`-prefixed members ($nextTick, $emit) are Vue's public
 *      instance API and are explicitly fine.
 *   8. THE DOM ENVIRONMENT. One word in one config file, and the repo can
 *      disagree with the standard on it for as long as nobody reads both on the
 *      same day.
 * ONE SECTION IS CONDITIONAL and says so in the output rather than passing
 * quietly: 5 needs `coverage/coverage-summary.json`, which only exists after a
 * `--coverage` run. CI orders this gate after one. Locally, `npm run test:check`
 * straight after `npm test` skips that section, and the summary names what it
 * skipped so a green tick never overstates itself.
 * NOT CHECKED, deliberately:
 *   - Whether a test is any good. Section 5 catches a file with no test at all;
 *     nothing here tells a thorough suite from one that executes every line and
 *     asserts almost nothing.
 *   - Whether a test has an assertion. The standard forbids assertionless tests,
 *     but a call that returns a value into an `expect` built three lines earlier
 *     is indistinguishable from one that does nothing without running the suite.
 *   - The priority order (security → utilities → services → composables →
 *     components). It describes what to write NEXT — a property of a backlog,
 *     not of the tree.
 *   - Anything about the assembled app. There is no E2E suite by design, which
 *     is exactly why `npm run dev` is on the PR checklist.
