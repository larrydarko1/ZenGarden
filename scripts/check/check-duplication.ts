/**
 * Duplication (DRY) gate. The rules — the per-format ceilings, the cap on any single
 * clone, and (in a repo with more than one scan root) the bans on a block copied
 * between two of them and on one exported type name declared in two of them — live in
 * @larrydarko/lint-config/gates/duplication. This repo has one scan root, so the last
 * two have nothing to compare and say nothing.
 *
 * What stays here is the numbers, and every one of them is a judgement rather than a
 * measurement. They only ever go down. Split by format because the three have
 * genuinely different stakes and one blended number hides all of them.
 *
 * jscpd matches tokens, not intent: two blocks that look identical and mean different
 * things are a false positive, and the honest answer is to raise the relevant ceiling
 * with a comment rather than contort the code.
