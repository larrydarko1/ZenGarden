/**
 * Document-level standards gate for the renderer shell.
 *   1. THE DOCUMENT SHELL. src/renderer/index.html is the one file ESLint's Vue
 *      parser never reads — no rule can assert `lang` or a charset exists.
 *   2. THE CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY META TAG. In a packaged build the renderer
 *      loads over `file://`, where there is no server to send a CSP header, so
 *      this tag IS the policy. It is also the only thing standing between a
 *      malicious note — markdown is rendered, and there are `v-html` sites — and
 *      script execution inside a window that can talk to the main process.
 *      Checked positively (the locked directives must be present) and negatively
 *      (`unsafe-eval` and remote script/connect origins must not appear), because
 *      a CSP degrades silently: a directive someone widened still parses, still
 *      loads the app, and reports nothing.
 *   3. NO REMOTE SUBRESOURCES. Leaf's claim is that nothing leaves the device.
 *      A single remote `<script>`/`<link>` in the shell breaks that claim, at
 *      the one point where CSP is also the only guard.
 *   4. THE REDUCED-MOTION ESCAPE HATCH. 84 transition/animation declarations are
 *      spread across 26 SFCs; one global override is what makes all of them
 *      honour `prefers-reduced-motion`. Stylelint can police how a rule is
 *      written but not that a rule still EXISTS, and deleting it would be
 *      invisible in review and silent at runtime.
 * NOT CHECKED, deliberately — this is a packaged desktop app, not a web page:
 *   - `<meta name="viewport">`, `theme-color`, `<link rel="icon">`. There is no
 *     mobile viewport, no browser chrome and no tab; the window icon comes from
 *     BrowserWindow (`icon:`) and electron-builder.
 *   - `<title>`. src/main/index.ts sets `title: ''` on purpose. A `<title>` here
 *     would override the window title the main process chose.
 *   - og:*, twitter:*, canonical, `<meta name="description">`. Nothing crawls a
 *     `file://` document. Requiring them would be cargo cult.
