/**
 * Error-handling gate.
 *   1. EVERY IPC HANDLER CONTAINS ITS OWN FAILURES. A throw inside
 *      `ipcMain.handle` does reach the renderer — as a rejected promise whose
 *      message has been flattened to a string and prefixed with
 *      "Error invoking remote method". The type is gone, the stack is the
 *      preload's, and any field the error carried is gone with it. So a handler
 *      catches its own failures and returns `{ success: false, error }`, which is
 *      why all 56 of them already do. This is the rule that keeps the 57th
 *      honest, because nothing about writing a throw here looks wrong.
 *   2. HANDLERS DO NOT THROW AT THEIR TOP LEVEL. The specific shape rule 1 misses:
 *      a `throw` reachable outside any try in the handler body — often a guard
 *      clause added later, above the try, where it reads perfectly.
 *   3. BOTH PROCESS-LEVEL BACKSTOPS EXIST. `uncaughtException` AND
 *      `unhandledRejection`. The app's startup and shutdown are `void`ed promise
 *      chains (`void app.whenReady().then(...)`), so a rejection in either has
 *      nowhere to surface: no window, no console the user will ever see, and in
 *      the default Node configuration it terminates the process. Without the
 *      handler, the entire diagnostic is that the app closed.
 *   4. SHUTDOWN RELEASES WHAT THE WINDOW CLOSING DOES NOT. `before-quit` is the
 *      only hook that runs while the services still exist. A process that has
 *      closed its window but not exited presents to the user as the app failing
 *      to quit, and to the next launch as a lock already taken. ZenGarden holds
 *      no native handle today, so CLEANUP_REQUIRED below is empty — the hook
 *      itself is still required, because the first service that needs releasing
 *      should find somewhere to be released from.
 *   5. A SWALLOWED FAILURE STATES ITS REASON. `no-empty` already rejects a truly
 *      empty block, and it accepts any comment at all — so it cannot ask the
 *      question that matters, which is why this particular failure is safe to
 *      drop. Every one of the 11 swallows in this codebase answers it
 *      (`/* doesn't exist yet — good *\/`); this keeps that true.
