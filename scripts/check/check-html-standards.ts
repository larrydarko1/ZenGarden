/**
 * Document-level standards gate for the renderer shell. `src/renderer/index.html` is
 * the one file ESLint's Vue parser never reads, and stylelint has the same blind spot
 * one level down: it can police how a rule is written but not that a rule still
 * EXISTS. The rules live in @larrydarko/lint-config/gates/html-standards.
 *
 * What stays here is this repo's answers.
 *
 * `require` is three tags: `lang`, which screen readers read before the app picks a
 * locale; `charset`; and `appMount`, because renaming `#app` renders nothing with no
 * error. `title` is left out because src/main/index.ts sets `title: ''` on purpose and
 * a `<title>` in the shell would override the window title the main process chose.
 * The shell does carry a viewport and a theme-color, for the Capacitor build that
 * serves the same file on Android, but they are not required here.
 *
 * `csp: true` — in a packaged build the renderer loads over `file://`, where there is
 * no server to send a header, so the meta tag IS the policy. It is checked positively
 * and negatively, because a CSP degrades silently: a directive someone widened still
 * parses, still loads the app, and reports nothing.
 *
 * The no-remote-subresources rule needs no option: this app's claim is that nothing
 * leaves the device, and a single remote `<script>` or `<link>` in the shell breaks
 * that claim at the one point where the CSP is also the only guard.
