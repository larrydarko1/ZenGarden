# Contributing to ZenGarden

ZenGarden is a personal portfolio project, maintained by one person. **It is not open to outside
contributions**, and pull requests from outside the repository will be closed unmerged.

This is not a comment on the quality of anyone's work. It is that a meditation app in a saturated
market does not need a second maintainer, and review time spent on it is time not spent on the thing
it exists to demonstrate. The only account with write access is
[Dependabot](dependabot.yml), which keeps dependencies and pinned GitHub Actions current.

The code is MIT licensed. Forking it, learning from it, and shipping your own version are all
explicitly fine — that is what the license is for.

## Reporting a security vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue.** Email <hello@larrydarko.dev> instead. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for what to include, what is in scope, and what to expect.

## Reporting a bug

Bug reports are welcome even though code contributions are not — use
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/larrydarko1/ZenGarden/issues) and include your OS, your app
version, and the steps to reproduce. Screenshots help. There is no service-level promise attached:
issues are read, and fixed when they are worth fixing.

## Building it yourself

Setup, development, testing, and packaging are all documented in the
[README](../README.md#getting-started). `npm run ci:check` runs the full gate the CI workflow runs.
